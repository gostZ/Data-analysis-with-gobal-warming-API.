# Data-analysis-with-gobal-warming-API.

## 1.	Data Identification & Collection: 
a)	Choose one of the APIs from the list of web APIs provided at this link: 
API-List 
When choosing an API, if it has free and paid access alternatives, be sure that the free tier provides the data access that you need. 
If you wish to use an API not on the list, you should discuss the objectives with the module coordinator. 
b)	Collect data from your chosen web API using Python. Note that, depending on the choice of API, you might need to repeat the collection process multiple times to download sufficient data for analysis.  

c)	Save the collected dataset in an appropriate format for subsequent analysis.

## 2.	Data preparation and analysis: 
a)	Load the saved dataset from Task 1 into an appropriate data structure.

b)	Apply any preprocessing steps that might be required to clean, filter or transform the dataset before analysis.

c)	Analyse, characterise, and summarise the cleaned dataset, using tables and visualisations where appropriate. Clearly explain each step of this process and interpret the results which are produced. Markdown cells should be used for the explanations and interpretations.

d)	At the end of notebook, summarise any insights which you gained from your analysis of the data, discuss the challenges faced in collecting data from the API, and suggest ideas for further analysis which could be performed on the data.
